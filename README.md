# CashRegister
#### Description: Fifth JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures project from FreeCodeCamp: Cash Register
#### Instructions:<br/>Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument. cid is a 2D array listing available currency. The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key. Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change. Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due. Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

This project is challenging and a good exercise involving math in the form of money. Converting to pennies makes it more straightforward.
